Important Notes
Make sure base code is down first
Then can adjust css files for visualizations
Finally can focus on proper app routing
This version of the PssP utilizes a different SQL Database layout (i.e. different tables) than the reference design. Both sets of tables, however, have been setup in MySql for testing purposes.
